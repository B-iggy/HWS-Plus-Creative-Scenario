hws_dlg_pKeKqe8,"The short version? The TSCG is the last and only hope for this whole Universe. The long version starts with Professor Void and the Elemental Galactic Services (EGS Corporation). There was a time that human kind realized that they will never solve their biggest threat of existence: the Energy Consumption. They never saw the real underlying issue of the human race: their spreading. Like a virus their numbers grew and grew. Conflicts arised because of that. Regular Blackouts happened. At the edge of extinction, there was this one man, Professor Void. Nobody believed him and his ideas to see the Universe more abstract. That there is more available than Pysics and Math. Their is a form of energy that is around everything and everyone: the Elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
