# HWS+ Creative Scenario

## Info

HWS Configs have the goal to enrich the Multiplayer gaming experience for the [HWS Servers](https://empyrion-homeworld.net), because the Vanilla Config files have the focus on Singleplayer.
It concentrates heavily on performance and fun, hence some values may differ from Vanilla.

I value feedback, so the Config files are constantly changing based on the Community interaction with them.

The main intention for this repository is for HWS players to test and work with the HWS Configs for HWS - in form of an easy to use Scenario.

### Elemental Weapon System (EWS)
HWS uses a detailed Rock-Paper-Scissors principle for Weapons and Materials. A quick sheet can be seen here:

## Known problems

* Shield Extender have no final size yet. Need dedicated models for the small version.

* Elemental Hand Weapons do not shoot sometimes (need to find a repro). After a relog they work again.

* if you try to access anything related to suitprops (for example the SnowmanHead), you get a red error in the console. I will not share my suitprops bundle as long as it's not needed.
